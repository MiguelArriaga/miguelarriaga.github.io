<p class="translation">
    Enquanto descia ao rio para rezar, meditando na velha tradição, e em quem deverá usar a coroa brilhante, Bom Senhor mostra-me o caminho! Irmãs vamos descer, vamos descer, venham descer, irmãs vamos descer ao rio para rezar. Enquanto descia ao rio para rezar, meditando na velha tradição, e em quem deverá usar a capa e a coroa, Bom Senhor mostra-me o caminho! Pecadores, vamos descer…
