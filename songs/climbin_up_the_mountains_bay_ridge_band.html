    Climbin’ up the mountains, children,<br>
    Didn’t come here for to stay,<br>
    If I’m never more to see you again,<br>
    I’m gonna meet you at the judgement day!

<p class="verse show-chords">
    Moses went down into Egypt land, he told old Pharaoh,<br>
    That the good Lord’s sittin’ on His heavenly Throne.<br>
    He said «Let my people go!»,<br>
    «Good Lord! Let my people go!».

<p class="verse show-chords">
    Daniel in the den of lions, he did begin to pray,<br>
    And the angels of the Lord locked the lion’s jaw,<br>
    That sure was a mighty day,<br>
    Good Lord! Sure was a mighty day!
</p>
<p class="verse show-chords">
    Children in the fiery furnace, they did begin to pray,<br>
    And the angels of the Lord put the fire out,<br>
    That sure was a mighty day,<br>
    Good Lord! Sure was a mighty day!
