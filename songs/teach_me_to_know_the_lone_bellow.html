    The Lone Bellow

<p class="verse show-chords">
    First born<br>
    Carried promise of the old one<br>
    You're the same but somehow different<br>
    Bared the burdens of the line
</p>
<p class="verse show-chords">
    It breaks in<br>
    And you never see it coming<br>
    Seems like every other morning<br>
    Like a secret you can't tell
</p>
<p class="chorus show-chords">
    And you get carried away<br>
    Carried away<br>
    (Carried away, carried away)<br>
    Carried away<br>
    (Carried away, carried away)
</p>
<p class="verse show-chords">
    Out there<br>
    Thousand years into the future<br>
    Almost nothing of it seems sure<br>
    Things so rarely stay the same
</p>
<p class="verse show-chords">
    Right here<br>
    In these burning simple seconds<br>
    Living out all your best guesses<br>
    Someone's calling out your name
</p>
<p class="chorus show-chords">
    And you get carried away<br>
    Carried away<br>
    (Carried away, carried away)<br>
    Carried away<br>
    (Carried away, carried away)<br>
    Carried away <br>
    (Carried away, carried away)<br>
    Carried away<br>
    (Carried away, carried away)
</p>
<p class="verse show-chords">
    Teach me to know my number of days<br>
    Hold out my heart from getting carried<br>
    (x3)
</p>
